# Full-Stack Note-Taker App
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/buster35/note-taker-app)
## Description
With this project I wanted to practice creating a responsive app that has both client-side and server-side components.
I decided to build this app in order to test my understanding of the Express.js framework used for building server-side routing, and of course to further my understanding of using JavaScript to dynamically send and receive data.
This app allows the user to create notes that can be saved on the page so that the user can keep track of various tasks, and delete them as they progress through them.
As stated earlier, this project helped further my understanding of the technical side of back-end web design, including learning things like route listeners, middleware and file structuring.

## Installation
Because this app will be deployed on Heroku it is not necessary for the end-user to use a command line to execute the program. The user will simply visit the link below to access the app, and will be able to enjoy it in the comfort of their browser.
## Usage
Upon arrival at the splash screen the user may click the blue button in the middle of the screen which will take them to the home page. The home page consists of a main "note-taking" field that will allow the user to type in a note title and task description. From here the user may save the note by clicking on the save floppy disk icon in the top right corner of the screen. Then, additional notes may be added using the plus icon, deleted using the red trash can icon, or become active again by clicking on the note stored in the left-hand column.
